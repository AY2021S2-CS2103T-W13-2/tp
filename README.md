SmartLib is a desktop app for managing private book loaning services owning less than 10,000 books, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SmartLib can systematically manage your books and borrowersâ€™ information in a more efficient manner than traditional GUI apps.

Type the command in the command box and press Enter to access various features. e.g. typing listbook and pressing Enter will list all the current in-store books.
